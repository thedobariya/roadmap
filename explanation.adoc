= System Resource Usage Script Explained

== Overview
This script provides real-time system resource usage details, including:

- **Total CPU Usage**
- **Total Memory Usage** (Free vs Used including percentage)
- **Total Disk Usage** (Free vs Used including percentage)
- **Top 5 Processes by CPU Usage**
- **Top 5 Processes by Memory Usage**

== Explanation

=== 1. Total CPU Usage
[source,bash]
----
top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print 100 - $8"%"}'
----
* `top -bn1`: Runs `top` in batch mode once to get CPU stats.
** `top`: a command-line tool that provides real-time system resource usage.
** `-b`: Batch mode (non-interactive). Runs `top` in batch mode (useful for scripts).
** `-n1`: Run `top` only once. (prevents continuous refresh).

* `grep "Cpu(s)"`: Extracts the CPU usage line.
* `awk '{print 100 - $8"%"}'`: Calculates the CPU usage by subtracting the idle percentage ($8) from 100.
** `$8`: Represents the idle CPU percentage.
** `print 100 - $8`: calculates the used CPU percentage.`
** `"%"`: Appends the percentage symbol.

=== 2. Total Memory Usage
[source,bash]
----
free -m | awk 'NR==2{printf "Used: %sMB / Total: %sMB (%.2f%%)\n", $3, $2, $3*100/$2}'
----
* `free -m`: Displays memory usage in MB.
* `awk 'NR==2{...}'`:
  - Extracts **Total and Used Memory**.
  - `$2`: Total memory.
  - `$3`: Used memory.
  - `printf` formats the output.

=== 3. Total Disk Usage
[source,bash]
----
df -h --total | grep "total" | awk '{printf "Used: %s / Total: %s (%.2f%%)\n", $3, $2, $5}'
----
* `df -h --total`: Shows disk usage in a human-readable format.
* `grep "total"`: Extracts the total disk usage line.
* `awk '{printf "Used: %s / Total: %s (%.2f%%)\n", $3, $2, $5}'`: Formats the output.

=== 4. Top 5 Processes by CPU Usage
[source,bash]
----
ps -eo pid,comm,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head -n 6
----
* `ps -eo pid,comm,%cpu`: Lists processes with their CPU usage.
** `ps`: Reports a snapshot of the current processes.
** `-e`: Selects all processes.
** `-o pid,comm,%cpu`: Displays:
*** `pid`: Process ID.
*** `comm`: Command name.
*** `%cpu`: CPU usage.
* `--sort=-%cpu`: Sorts processes by CPU usage in descending order.
* `head -n 6`: Displays the top 5 processes (1 header + 5 processes).

=== 5. Top 5 Processes by Memory Usage
[source,bash]
----
ps -eo pid,comm,%mem --sort=-%mem | head -n 6
----
* `ps -eo pid,comm,%mem`: Lists processes with their memory usage in percentage.
gi
* `--sort=-%mem`: Sorts processes by memory usage in descending order.
* `head -n 6`: Displays the top 5 memory-consuming processes (plus header row).

== Running the Script

1. Save the script as `system_usage.sh`:
   ```bash
   nano system_usage.sh
   ```
   Paste the script inside and save.

2. Give it execute permission:
   ```bash
   chmod +x system_usage.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./system_usage.sh
   ```

== Example Output
```
================ System Resource Usage ================
Total CPU Usage: 12.5%
Total Memory Usage: Used: 1450MB / Total: 8000MB (18.12%)
Total Disk Usage: Used: 100GB / Total: 500GB (20%)
=======================================================
Top 5 Processes by CPU Usage:
  PID COMMAND         %CPU
